# StockMarketSim
Project given by EECS 281 @ UofM  
This program is basically a reskin of the classic "stock market simulator" project, with star wars! Money is "Force", stocks are "planets", etc.  
As one of my first "big" programs, it really tests a lot of programming and C++ specific skills. Programming between multiple files, polymorphism, object oriented programming, and thorough testing are just a few.  
*This is an older project so it's a little messy, but it's a good example of a lot of the above skills.*
