# StockMarketSim
Project given by EECS 281 @ UofM  
This program is basically a reskin of the classic "stock market simulator" project, with star wars! Money is "Force", stocks are "planets", etc.  
The project shows off many programming and C++ specific skills. Polymorphism, object oriented programming, and thorough testing / debugging are just a few.
